# Privacy Policy

## Overview

Secret Camera ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your information is handled when using our application.

## Information Collection and Use

Secret Camera is designed with privacy as its core principle. We prioritize local storage and minimal data collection.

### Data We Collect

The only data we collect is what is automatically collected by Google Play Services, which includes:

- Basic device information
- App crash reports
- App performance data
- Installation and uninstallation statistics

### Data We DO NOT Collect

We want to be explicitly clear about what we don't collect:

- We do not collect your photos
- We do not collect your camera data
- We do not collect your personal information
- We do not track your location
- We do not have access to your stored content
- We do not maintain any servers that store your data

## Photo Storage

### Local Storage

- All photos taken through the app are stored exclusively on your device in a private, app-specific directory
- Photos are not uploaded to any cloud service by our app
- Photos are only accessible through the Secret Camera unless you explicitly choose to share them
- If you uninstall the app, all photos stored in the app's private directory will be permanently deleted

## Required Permissions

Our app requires certain permissions to function:

1. **Camera**: Required to take photos
2. **Microphone**: Required for future video capture support
3. **Storage**: Required to save photos in your device's private app directory

These permissions are used solely for the app's core functionality and not for data collection.

## Third-Party Services

The only third-party service we use is Google Play Services, which is required for app distribution and basic functionality on Android devices. Please refer to Google's Privacy Policy for information about their data collection practices.

## Data Security

We implement security measures by:

- Storing all photos in a private, app-specific directory
- Not transmitting any photos or user data over the internet
- Not maintaining any servers or databases with user information

## Children's Privacy

Our app does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. Check the history in the repository for the previous versions.

## Your Rights

Since we don't collect or store any of your personal data on our servers, there is no personal data for you to request access to or deletion of. All your photos and data are stored locally on your device and are under your complete control.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at [michael@standen.link](mailto:michael@standen.link).

## Deletion of Data

To remove all data associated with the Secret Camera:

1. Uninstall the application from your device
2. This will automatically remove all photos stored in the app's private directory
3. No additional steps are required as we don't store any data on servers

## Compliance

This privacy policy complies with:

- Google Play Store requirements
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

By using Secret Camera, you agree to this Privacy Policy.
